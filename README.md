# Space Hack!!

When space travelers get exposed to variable levels of electromagnetic radiations, they suffer from skin related and other problems.

This is a body wear which can be worn by space travelers. It monitors the traveler's body conditions and the surrounding condition such as 
electromagnetic wave radiation level, humidity, pressure, ambient temperature, surface temperature (object temperature).

This body wear has a sniffer (a mobile phone for now) which sniffs the real time data about the traveler and his surrounding.

Once the user is back, we can export the data to PC and can obtain some time based analytic. We can plot a graph which shows us different level 
of parameters. This app when implemented in future, can detect unusual activity and warn the user to avoid some magnetic wave.

PC client can be found at the following repository:

## Sorry for lot of dot files, (too lazy to write .gitignore files)

## Contribution
It'd be awesome if we get some contributors, please send us pull requests in small chunks with subject of the modification, please avoid huge 
modification in a single pull request.
